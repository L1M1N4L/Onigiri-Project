        <h1 class="content-heading">Introduction to Pitch Accent (PA)</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          In the world of Japanese pronunciation, Pitch Accent (PA) plays a crucial role, reminiscent of, but not identical to, English word and sentence stress.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="content-heading">Why PA Matters</h1>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          Unlike English, where stress involves pitch, loudness, and vowel length, PA in Japanese is primarily characterized by pitch—how high or low you modulate your voice.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="content-heading">Avoiding Pronunciation Pitfalls</h1>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          Without dedicated study, many English native speakers tend to unconsciously transfer the pronunciation rules of English to Japanese, leading to incorrect pronunciation.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="content-heading">The Power of PA</h1>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          PA becomes a distinguishing factor for homophones, words that would otherwise be identical in sound but differ in meaning.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="content-heading">Comparing with English Stress</h1>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          While English stress can differentiate nouns and verbs (e.g., PERmit vs. perMIT) and highlight nuances in compound nouns and adjectives plus nouns (e.g., GREENhouse vs. GREEN HOUSE), PA serves a similar purpose in Japanese.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="content-heading">Emphasis in Expression</h1>
      <p class="content-para japanese-text">
          Similar to how English stress can be used to emphasize words in a sentence (e.g., THIS is great vs. This IS great vs. This is GREAT), PA allows for nuanced expression in Japanese.

  </div>



  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      Figuring out Pitch Accent (PA) in Japanese can be tricky for a few reasons, keeping many learners from discovering this important part of speaking Japanese.
  </p>

  <h1 class="content-heading">Concerns from Teachers</h1>
  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      <b>Worry About Confusion:</b> Some teachers are afraid that teaching PA might confuse or overwhelm learners, making them frustrated and maybe even quit.
  </p>
  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      <b>Our Thought:</b> But We believe learning PA can be cool and helpful—it adds a nice touch to your Japanese skills.
  </p>

  <h1 class="content-heading">Things People Say</h1>
  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      <b>"Japanese people will understand you anyways":</b> Well, that might be true sometimes, but if your PA is wrong, you might become hard to understand. And who wants to sound like they're speaking Japanese with a funny English accent? :P
  </p>

  <h1 class="content-heading">Not Enough Easy Info</h1>
  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      <b>Not Many Learning Tools:</b> It's hard to find good PA resources in simple English. Most information is in Japanese, making it tough for English speakers.
  </p>
  <p class="content-para japanese-text">

  <p class="content-para japanese-text">
      Overcoming these challenges is key for everyone who wants to make their Japanese even better.
